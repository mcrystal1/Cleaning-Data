# Cleaning-Data
The goal of this code is to clean and tidy the wearable dataset which foucses on mean and standard deviation of the different variables.
The R script run_analysis.R accomplishes that goal by:
1. Downloading the raw training, testing and subject data sets and unzipping the files.
2. merging all files to one data set.
3. Give appropriate names to all variables.
4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation.
5. Ouputs a tidy data set stored in a text file.
